>Modeling housing data using both R and Python

The [House Prices Kaggle competiton](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) is a common project for budding data scientists to familiarize themselves with regression methods and how to apply them to predicting price data. Whether you are learning R or Python, whether you are an experienced programmer or just starting your first language, this repo has something for you. The R scripts were originally written during my undergrad and re-written a year later more efficiently and effectively using Python.
